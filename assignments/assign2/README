The directories part1, part2 and part3 contain skeleton code and a vivado script to help you get started in the assignment.

When beginning work on one part of the assignment:

Open Vivado and in the TCL Console:
1) change directory (cd) into one of the directories
2) run: source create_design.tcl

This will create a new project subdirectory, load in the verilog file and set up constraints. From this starting project you can modify the code, add test files and run your design through implementation.

The projects are constrained to implement the design "out of context" which means no I/O buffers will be inserted. This makes the design more invariant to pin locations and simplifies timing analysis.
